Scan Type: Credentialed local assessment
Assessment Duration: ~15 minutes
```

---

## 🧪 Methodology & Execution

### Phase 1: 🔍 Initial Discovery
**Objective:** Establish baseline security posture

```bash
# Network service enumeration
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN

# Nessus scan configuration
Target: 127.0.0.1
Policy: Basic Network Scan (credentialed)
Duration: ~15 minutes
```

**📊 Initial Findings:**
```
Total Vulnerabilities: 8
├── 🔴 High: 2 (Node.js RCE, Adobe privilege escalation)
├── 🟡 Medium: 4 (FTP proxy, additional Adobe issues)  
├── 🟢 Low: 2 (UPnP exposure, certificate warnings)
└── ℹ️ Info: Multiple (OS fingerprinting, service banners)
```

### Phase 2: ⚡ Risk-Based Remediation

| Priority | Vulnerability | CVSS | Remediation Action | Verification Method |
|----------|---------------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 🔴 **P1** | Node.js CVE-2023-30581 | 9.8 | `brew upgrade node` | Version check + npm audit |
| 🟡 **P2** | Adobe CC outdated | 7.2 | Internal updater | Version verification |
| 🟡 **P2** | FTP proxy (8021) | 6.5 | `launchctl unload` | Port scan confirmation |
| 🟢 **P3** | UPnP/AirPlay exposure | 4.3 | System Preferences | Service status check |

### Phase 3: 🔧 Technical Implementation

<details>
<summary><b>Node.js Security Update</b></summary>

```bash
# Before: Node.js v14.15.1 (End of Life)
node --version
# Output: v14.15.1

# Update process
brew update && brew upgrade node
npm audit fix --force

# After: Node.js v18.19.0 (Current LTS)
node --version  
# Output: v18.19.0

# Verify npm vulnerabilities addressed
npm audit
# Output: found 0 vulnerabilities
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Service Hardening</b></summary>

```bash
# Disable FTP proxy service
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp-proxy.plist

# Verify service stopped
netstat -an | grep 8021
# Output: (no results - port closed)

# Disable AirPlay via System Preferences
# System Preferences → Sharing → AirPlay Receiver: OFF
```

</details>

### Phase 4: ✅ Validation & Verification

**📈 Post-Remediation Scan Results:**
```
Remediation Effectiveness:
├── Critical/High: 0 (Previously: 2) ✅ 100% resolved
├── Medium: 1 (Previously: 4) ✅ 75% resolved  
├── Low: 1 (Previously: 2) ✅ 50% resolved
└── Remaining: Non-actionable cert warnings only
```

**🌐 Network Service Verification:**
```bash
# Before remediation
PORT     STATE SERVICE
5000/tcp open  airplay
7000/tcp open  afs3-fileserver  
8021/tcp open  ftp-proxy
3000/tcp open  node.js

# After remediation  
PORT     STATE SERVICE
443/tcp  open  https (system services only)
# Previously vulnerable services confirmed closed
```
