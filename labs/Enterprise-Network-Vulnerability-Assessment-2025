├── Smart Home: 3 (TP-Link smart plug critical)
├── Entertainment: 3 (Vizio TV SSL POODLE)
├── Network Infrastructure: 2 (Weak DH groups)
└── Personal Devices: 2 (Secure configuration)
```

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis & Exploitation

#### TP-Link Smart Plug Critical Vulnerability
```bash
# Proof of concept - unauthorized device control
python3 tplink_smartplug.py -t 192.168.0.12 -c info
# Result: Complete device information disclosure without authentication

python3 tplink_smartplug.py -t 192.168.0.12 -c on
python3 tplink_smartplug.py -t 192.168.0.12 -c off
# Result: Full device control capabilities confirmed
```

#### Vizio TV SSL POODLE Testing
```bash
# SSL vulnerability confirmation
nmap --script ssl-poodle 192.168.0.16
# Result: VULNERABLE - SSL 3.0 padding oracle attack possible

# Service accessibility verification
telnet 192.168.0.16 8099
# Result: Connection successful to vulnerable SSL service
```

#### Router Infrastructure Assessment
```bash
# Cipher suite analysis
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers 192.168.0.1
# Result: Weak DH GROUP 1 (1024-bit) detected

# Multiple router assessment
nmap --script ssl-dh-params 192.168.0.4
# Result: Same vulnerability confirmed on network extender
```

### Phase 3: Risk-Based Remediation Implementation

#### Priority 1: Critical IoT Device Isolation
```bash
# TP-Link device isolation via router Access Scheduler
Router Configuration:
- Device: HS105 (192.168.0.12)
- Schedule: Block internet access 24/7
- Local Access: Maintained for functionality
- Result: Device isolated from external threats
```

#### Priority 2: Smart TV Complete Isolation
```bash
# Vizio TV network disconnection
Action: WiFi settings disable via TV interface
Verification: nmap -sn 192.168.0.16
Result: Host appears down (successful isolation)
```

#### Priority 3: Network Infrastructure Hardening
```bash
# Router security configuration enhancement
IPv4 Firewall: Enabled with high security level
IPv6 Firewall: Enabled with stealth mode activation
Custom Rules: Block vulnerable service ports
Access Control: Restrictive policies implemented
```

### Phase 4: Verification & Validation Testing

#### Post-Remediation Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
# Comprehensive network re-scan
nmap --script vuln 192.168.0.0/24
# Result: Zero critical vulnerabilities detected

# Specific device exploitation testing
python3 tplink_smartplug.py -t 192.168.0.12 -c info
# Result: Connection timeout (successful blocking confirmed)

# SSL service accessibility testing
telnet 192.168.0.16 8099
# Result: Connection refused (device successfully isolated)
```
