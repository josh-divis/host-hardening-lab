# Custom firewall rules for service blocking
IPv4 Firewall Rules Created:
- Block TP-Link port 9999
- Block SSL POODLE ports 8099, 9080  
- Block Amazon Echo ports 1080, 8888, 9091
```

#### Phase 2: Network Infrastructure Hardening
```bash
# Router security configuration
IPv4 Firewall: Enabled with high security level
IPv6 Firewall: Enabled with stealth mode
Service Blocking: Risky protocols disabled
Access Control: Restrictive policies implemented
```

#### Phase 3: Device-Level Remediation
```bash
# Vizio TV complete isolation
Action: WiFi disconnection via TV settings
Verification: nmap -sn 192.168.0.16
Result: Host appears down (successful isolation)

# Wyze Camera assessment
Action: Identified as end-of-life product
Recommendation: Device replacement with supported model
Status: User action item for hardware upgrade
```

#### Phase 4: Verification & Validation
```bash
# Post-remediation verification scans
nmap --script vuln 192.168.0.0/24
# Result: No critical vulnerabilities detected

# Specific device testing
python3 tplink_smartplug.py -t 192.168.0.12 -c info
# Result: Connection timeout (successful blocking)

telnet 192.168.0.16 8099
# Result: Connection refused (device isolated)
```
