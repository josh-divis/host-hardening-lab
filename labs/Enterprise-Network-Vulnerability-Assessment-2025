💼 Business Impact Assessment

🔍 Key Findings

Device/Service	CVE/Issue	Severity	Description
TP-Link IoT Plug	Proprietary port 9999	CRITICAL	Unauthenticated remote control
Vizio Smart TV	SSL POODLE (CVE-2014-3566)	HIGH	Legacy SSL allowed MITM
Core Router	Weak DH Group 1	MEDIUM	Vulnerable to passive eavesdropping
Amazon Echo	Multi-port exposure	MEDIUM	Unused services left open
Wyze Cam v1	EOL with unpatched flaws	HIGH	Ineligible for patching

💸 Cost of Inaction
	•	Reputation Damage from IoT compromise
	•	Compliance Violation risk for known flaws
	•	Internal Pivoting Risk via smart home gear

⸻

🚨 Attack Scenarios Prevented

1️⃣ IoT Pivot Chain
	•	Vector: TP-Link Port 9999 → Lateral Movement
	•	Impact: Entire network compromise
	•	Fix: Firewall schedule to isolate IoT

2️⃣ SSL Downgrade on Smart TV
	•	Vector: CVE-2014-3566 exploited → Cred Theft
	•	Impact: Privacy violation, account compromise
	•	Fix: Removed from Wi-Fi

3️⃣ Router DH Weakness
	•	Vector: DH Group 1 → MITM Possibility
	•	Impact: Full infrastructure compromise
	•	Fix: Firewall hardening + stealth mode

🛠️ Tools & Environment

🔧 Tools Used
	•	Nmap: Port discovery, vulnerability detection
	•	Python: TP-Link control PoC scripts
	•	Telnet: Legacy service validation
	•	Router Config: Schedule, ACL, port blocks

🖥️ Environment
	•	Devices: 17 (Cameras, Plugs, TVs, Routers)
	•	IP Range: 192.168.0.0/24

⸻

🧪 Methodology & Execution

Phase 1: Discovery

nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
nmap --script vuln 192.168.0.0/24

Result: 17 live devices; 5 with critical issues

Phase 2: Exploitation

python3 tplink_smartplug.py -t 192.168.0.12 -c on
nmap --script ssl-poodle 192.168.0.16

PoCs confirmed severity and exploitability

Phase 3: Remediation

# TP-Link firewall block
# Vizio Wi-Fi disconnect
# Router: enable IPv6 stealth + new ACL rules

Phase 4: Validation

nmap --script vuln 192.168.0.0/24  # All clear

💡 Key Insights & Lessons Learned

🔬 Technical
	•	IoT security requires network-based controls
	•	EOL devices should be physically isolated
	•	Nmap is a powerful but underused validator

📈 Process
	•	Risk-based prioritization improved efficiency
	•	Documentation speeds repeatability
	•	Verification post-change is non-negotiable

⸻

🧭 Recommendations for Production

🔧 Immediate
	1.	Scan entire network monthly with automated tools
	2.	Isolate IoT to VLANs with strict rules
	3.	EOL Removal Plan for outdated devices

🧱 Strategic
	•	Migrate to Zero Trust Segmentation
	•	Use SIEM integration for device anomalies
	•	Enforce config baseline with change tracking
